# MotionBlendAI
Creating lifelike character animations requires smoothly transitioning between different motion clips. Traditional blending often relies on manual tweaking or large motion datasets. Recent single-shot GAN models (e.g. GANimator) can generate entire motions from one example, but lack built-in blending controls.
