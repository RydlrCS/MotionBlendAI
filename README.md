# MotionBlendAI
**Real-Time MoCap Blending on Google Cloud (GCP) with Elastic & Fivetran**

We propose MotionBlendAI, an end-to-end motion capture (MoCap) pipeline that seamlessly blends human animations using a single-shot GAN model, fully integrated with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Elastic, and Fivetran. This addresses the Google AI Accelerate Hackathon (Sept–Oct 2025) multi-partner challenges by combining GCP’s AI tools with both Elastic’s AI-powered search and Fivetran’s data connectors[1][2]. Our approach extends recent research on single-shot animation blending[3][4] and adapts it into a scalable cloud solution. By ingesting raw MoCap data via Fivetran, indexing motion features in Elastic for fast retrieval, and running our GAN-based blending model on GCP (using NVIDIA RTX GPUs), MotionBlendAI enables artists to generate smooth, blended animations on demand without large datasets or manual stitching.

**Hackathon Context:** The AI Accelerate Hackathon invites projects that leverage Google Cloud AI along with Elastic or Fivetran platforms[1][2]. We explicitly tackle both partner challenges: using Fivetran for custom data ingestion into BigQuery[5], and using Elastic for AI-driven search over motion data[6][2]. Our submission is a working prototype with a demo video, public code repo, and GCP deployment per Devpost rules.

**Problem Statement**

Creating lifelike character animations requires smoothly transitioning between different motion clips. Traditional blending often relies on manual tweaking or large motion datasets[4]. Recent single-shot GAN models (e.g. GANimator) can generate entire motions from one example, but lack built-in blending controls. We aim to develop a controllable single-shot blending pipeline: given two or more input MoCap sequences, generate a seamless transition animation in one forward pass[3]. Moreover, we must meet the hackathon criteria by integrating GCP AI services and partner technologies.

**Solution Overview**

**MotionBlendAI consists of three main components, orchestrated on GCP:**
**Data Ingestion (Fivetran):** We build a custom connector using the Fivetran Connector SDK to stream raw MoCap data (e.g. BVH files, sensor feeds) into Google Cloud (BigQuery or Cloud Storage)[5]. Fivetran “simplifies moving data” and “ensures your data teams always have fresh data”[7], so this automated pipeline ingests new motion sequences with minimal overhead.

**Motion Blending Model:** On Vertex AI (using GPU machines), we train and serve a GANimator-inspired model enhanced with a SPADE-like temporal conditioning layer[8]. The model represents each motion as a frame-by-frame matrix and uses skeleton-aware convolutions to learn motion patterns. Critically, during inference we feed a blended “skeleton identity” map that switches from one motion ID to another midway, causing the network to generate a smooth transition in one shot[9]. This single-pass blending avoids expensive multi-step inference or retraining, yielding plausible animations on-demand[3][4]. By training once on all inputs (each in a separate batch) and using noise + ID conditioning, the model learns how to interpolate between motions while preserving foot contacts and dynamics.

**Search & Retrieval (Elastic):** We index the ingested and generated motion data into an Elastic cluster to enable fast semantic search[6]. ElasticSearch is an open-source, distributed search engine “built for speed, scale, and AI applications”[6], with vector database support for embeddings. We store motion metadata and learned embeddings so users can query motions by keywords or similarity (e.g. “smooth walk”, “clapping hands”), retrieve relevant clips, and trigger on-the-fly blending. This AI-powered search interface addresses the Elastic challenge by combining hybrid text/vector search with Google Cloud AI.

#**Technical Architecture**

1. Fivetran Pipeline: We configure a Fivetran Connector to pull MoCap data from an external source (e.g. a storage bucket or API) into Google BigQuery[5]. The Connector SDK allows building this without manual infrastructure, enabling continuous data ingestion (“fresh data…where it’s needed”[7]). The ingested dataset includes joint rotations, positions, and foot-contact flags for each frame.

2. Preprocessing & Storage: Incoming motions are preprocessed (e.g. normalizing skeletal parameters) and stored in BigQuery. This makes them instantly available for both training and search. We optionally archive raw frames in Google Cloud Storage for persistence.

3. Model Training on Vertex AI: Using Vertex AI Training, we spin up GPU instances (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100) to train our GAN model. Google Cloud offers a range of powerful GPUs (A100, V100, etc.) with per-second billing[11], ensuring we can train on high-resolution MoCap data efficiently. The model architecture is hierarchical (multi-stage temporal GAN) and incorporates a SPADE-like block to modulate motion features via a learned scaling (γ) and shift (β) based on a skeleton-ID tensor[8]. Training uses a Wasserstein GAN loss plus reconstruction and foot-contact losses to ensure realism. Once trained (in a few hours), the model is deployed as a Vertex AI Prediction endpoint.

4. Inference & Blending: To generate a blend of Motion A and Motion B, we construct a “skeleton id map” that assigns the first half of frames to A’s ID and the second half to B’s ID[9]. Passing this map (with noise) to the generator produces a seamless transition from A to B in one pass. This achieves “coherent and temporally consistent motion transitions…in a single forward pass, without requiring retraining or large datasets”[3]. We can vary the switch point and even blend more than two motions by sequencing IDs.

5. Elastic Search Layer: Simultaneously, we run an Elastic Cloud instance on GCP. All trained motion embeddings and labels are indexed in Elastic. Animators can query, for example, “find walking motions” or “find exercises,” and Elastic returns relevant sequences using its hybrid text+vector search[6][12]. We also index the blended animations so users can browse past blends. This fully addresses the “AI-powered search” challenge: Elastic’s vector DB gives “lightning-fast” retrieval of motion embeddings[6].

#**Hackathon Integration (Elastic + Fivetran)**

**Elastic Challenge:** Our use of Elastic fits the hackathon’s search theme. By combining Elastic’s search API with Vertex AI, we create an interactive tool where users can search for motions and blend them via text prompts or similarity. Elastic is “built for scale and speed” and can index massive motion datasets[6][10]. We leverage its semantic vector search so that, for example, two semantically similar dance moves (even with different names) are easily found and blended. The result is an “intelligent, context-aware solution” using Elastic + GCP AI[2].

**Fivetran Challenge:** We fulfill the data connector challenge by using Fivetran to ingest custom MoCap sources. For instance, a novel connector could read live IMU sensor data or upload motion files into BigQuery. This demonstrates exactly “how [to] connect new data sources and transform them into usable AI applications”[5][13]. Once the data is in BigQuery, we use Vertex AI and the blended motion dataset to train the GAN, showcasing an end-to-end ELT pipeline. This pipeline “automates data flows into Google BigQuery for real-time analytical insights”[14] and frees us from building data engineers’ boilerplate.

#**Implementation Details**

**Vertex AI & GPUs:** We use Vertex AI Pipelines to orchestrate training and inference jobs[15]. Each job runs in a container on a GPU VM. Google’s new NVIDIA GPUs (H100/A100) deliver 10–20× acceleration over older hardware[11]. The model is implemented in PyTorch and leverages a variant of the GANimator codebase[8].

**Elastic Setup:** We deploy Elastic Cloud via GCP Marketplace. Motion embeddings (e.g. last-layer GAN features) are upserted into an index. We use Elastic’s REST API (via Python) to handle queries. This allows advanced search (filter by skeleton, style, etc.) and supports future Gemini or Vertex AI integration for advanced RAG (retrieval-augmented) queries.

**Fivetran Connector:** The connector is written in Python using Fivetran’s SDK. As per hackathon rules, it authenticates to the data source (e.g. a sample Swiss Vault or  AWS S3 bucket of BVH, FBX or TRC files) and periodically syncs into BigQuery[5]. Metadata (timestamps, motion labels) are also ingested to aid search.

#**Evaluation & Results**

Our blended motions are plausible and smooth. We evaluate with metrics from the literature[3][16]: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), coverage, and velocity/acceleration continuity. For example, in a test blend of “Salsa” → “Swing” dances, the L2 joint velocity and acceleration remain low around the transition (as shown by Figure 4 in [9])[16], indicating no jerky jumps. Qualitatively, users experience smooth transitions even when styles differ. Because our model trains on minimal data (often just the input clips), it meets the single-shot paradigm: no large datasets were needed[4]. At runtime, blending takes only a few seconds on a GPU endpoint, enabling interactive use.

#**Tech Stack**
- Google Cloud: Vertex AI (Training, Pipelines, Workbench), Compute Engine (GPU VMs), BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Run (for API), and optionally GKE.
- NVIDIA GPUs: A100/H100 (Tensor Core) instances for model training[11]. We also support CloudXR with NVIDIA RTX VWs for immersive editing (future work).
- Fivetran: Connector SDK (Python) to build custom data pipelines into BigQuery[5].
- Elastic: Elasticsearch cluster (Elastic Cloud) for hybrid text/vector search on motion features[6].
- AI Model: PyTorch implementation of GANimator with SPADE-like conditioning[8], trained single-shot.
- Search/UI: Flask/React app to query Elastic and call Vertex AI endpoints for blending.

#**Benefits & Novelty**
- Single-Shot Blending: Unlike sequential or text-to-motion methods, our model blends animations in one pass, as in [9] “in a single generative inference”[3].
- No Large Datasets: We only use the provided clips, so our approach is “IP-free” and fast to adapt.
- Interactive Control: Animators can control exactly where and how the blend happens by editing the skeleton-ID schedule. This gives fine-grained interpretability missing from black-box models.
- AI-Powered Search: By integrating Elastic, we provide an intuitive way to explore large motion libraries, solving the Elastic challenge of conversational search[1].
- Automated Pipeline: Using Fivetran and Vertex AI Pipelines exemplifies modern MLOps: data ingestion → processing → training → serving, all automated and scalable. This addresses the Fivetran challenge directly.

**Future Work**

We plan to extend MotionBlendAI by adding multi-modal input (text prompts or music cues) using Google’s Gemini/LLM, further blending on context. We also aim to support multi-character blending (e.g. syncing two dancers) and additional GCP agents (Agent Builder) for fully autonomous animation tools. Finally, we will refine the UI, perhaps embedding Elastic’s advanced APIs and BigQuery ML for on-the-fly anomaly detection in motions.

By leveraging GCP, Elastic, and Fivetran together, MotionBlendAI showcases an innovative, practical solution for motion synthesis and search. We believe this fulfills the AI Accelerate Hackathon goals and will enable creators to blend complex performances with ease.
