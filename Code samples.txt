Fivetran Custom Connector (Python → BigQuery)
Fivetran’s Connector SDK lets you build a data ingestion connector in Python and run it on Fivetran- managed compute 1 . In practice, you subclass fivetran_sdk.Connector and implement a connect() method that continuously pulls or receives data and calls self.load(...) to send rows into the Fivetran destination (BigQuery in this case). Fivetran handles scheduling and resource allocation
1 . For example, a simple “PoseStream” connector might look like: # fivetran_connector/PoseStreamConnector.py
  from fivetran_sdk import Connector
  class PoseStreamConnector(Connector):
      def connect(self):
          while True:
              # Grab the next motion-capture frame (3D joint coordinates,
  timestamp, etc.)
              frame = capture_next_frame()
  # Preprocess or filter the raw frame data (normalize, select joints, etc.)
              processed = preprocess(frame)
              # Load the processed frame into the BigQuery table via Fivetran
              self.load(processed)
• The connect() loop can be infinite (for real-time streams) or finite (batch ingestion).
• self.load(...) emits rows to be upserted into the connected BigQuery table.
• All scheduling, auth, and transport to BigQuery is managed by the Fivetran platform 1 .
This custom connector would be packaged and deployed through Fivetran’s UI or CLI. (See the Fivetran Connector SDK docs for setup and deployment details 1 .)
GANimator PyTorch Model (Training & Inference)
GANimator is a generative motion-synthesis model (SIGGRAPH 2022) that can learn a novel motion sequence from a single example 2 . It is implemented in PyTorch and typically trained on 3D skeleton/BVH data. A standard training loop involves sampling sequences, passing them through a generator, computing a GAN loss against real data, and backpropagating. For example, a simplified PyTorch training script might look like:
        1
 # ganimator/train.py (conceptual example)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
# (Define your GAN model, e.g., a Generator and Discriminator.)
class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__()
        # define layers...
    def forward(self, noise):
        # produce a motion sequence
        return generated_sequence
generator = Generator(...)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()  # placeholder for GAN-specific loss
# Assume `training_sequences` is a dataset of real motion sequences
dataloader = DataLoader(training_sequences, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for real_seq in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        noise = torch.randn(real_seq.size(0), latent_dim)
        generated_seq = generator(noise)
synthesize motion
        loss = loss_fn(generated_seq, real_seq)
loss or adversarial
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
# random
#
# e.g. L2
input
• In practice, GANimator’s code (e.g. [train.py] 3 ) uses specialized losses (reconstruction, contact, adversarial) and data loaders for BVH files. The above is a conceptual skeleton. The official repository shows usage like:
       python train.py --bvh_prefix=./data/Crabnew --bvh_name=Crab-dance-long --
       save_path={save_path}
to train on a “Crab-dance” motion 3 .
For inference (generating new motions), you would load the trained model and run it in evaluation mode. For example:
 2

 # ganimator/infer.py (conceptual example)
import torch
# Re-create the model architecture and load trained weights
generator = Generator(...)
generator.load_state_dict(torch.load('generator.pth'))
generator.eval()
# Generate a new motion from random seed or a conditional seed motion
seed_noise = torch.randn(1, latent_dim)
with torch.no_grad():
    new_motion = generator(seed_noise)
# `new_motion` is now a synthesized motion sequence (e.g., a NumPy array or
tensor).
 • The GANimator repository provides a demo.py script for synthesis using pretrained models practice you’d adapt that or use a custom script to load your generator and sample.
4 . In Overall, the GANimator model training/inference code follows standard PyTorch patterns. Cite the
repository for details on options and modes 4 3 .
Elastic Vector Indexing & Search Interface
To enable semantic/vector search over motions or descriptors, one can use Elasticsearch (Elastic) with its k- NN search feature. The pipeline is: (1) Convert data (e.g. motion embeddings or encoded features) into fixed-length vectors via an ML model, (2) index those vectors in an Elastic index, and (3) run k-nearest- neighbor queries at search time 5 6 . In Elastic, each document stores its metadata and a
float_vector field for the embedding; queries with knn find the closest vectors efficiently.
For example, a simple Flask API could wrap this logic. The Python elasticsearch client can perform a k-
NN query like:
  # elastic_search/app.py
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
  from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
  app = Flask(__name__)
  es = Elasticsearch([{"host": "localhost", "port": 9200}])
  @app.route('/search', methods=['POST'])
  def semantic_search():
      req = request.get_json()
      query_vector = req.get("vector")
      k = req.get("k", 10)
     3

        # Perform k-NN search on index "motions" using the vector field
  "motion_vector"
      response = es.search(index="motions", body={
          "size": k,
          "query": {
              "knn": {
                  "motion_vector": {
                      "vector": query_vector,
                      "k": k
} }
} })
      # Return the matching documents (source content) to the client
      hits = [hit["_source"] for hit in response["hits"]["hits"]]
      return jsonify(hits)
• This Flask app listens for POSTs with a JSON payload {"vector": [...], "k": 10} , runs an Elastic k-NN query, and returns the top- k results.
• The Elastic k-NN query (introduced in ES 8.x) uses approximate nearest neighbor search under the hood 5 6 .
• The index motions must have been created with a mapping that defines motion_vector as a dense_vector field. Indexing code (not shown) would bulk-add documents with their embedded
vectors (e.g. from the GANimator output).
For a user interface, a front-end (Flask templates or React, etc.) can send user text/pose queries and call this /search endpoint. (For example, a simple HTML form could POST to /search and display results.) This
architecture – embedding + Elastic + API – enables fast semantic search on motions or other data 5 6 . GCP Orchestration with Vertex AI Pipelines
Google Cloud’s Vertex AI Pipelines provides serverless orchestration for ML workflows 7 . You define a pipeline (usually in Kubeflow Pipelines DSL) and submit it to Vertex; Vertex runs the pipeline tasks (often on AI Platform Training jobs, etc.) and manages execution 7 . A typical pipeline definition might use the KFP Python SDK with Google Cloud components. For example:
  # vertex_pipeline/pipeline.py
  import kfp
  from google.cloud import aiplatform
  from google_cloud_pipeline_components.v1.dataset import ImageDatasetCreateOp
  from google_cloud_pipeline_components.v1.automl.training_job import
  AutoMLImageTrainingJobRunOp
  from google_cloud_pipeline_components.v1.endpoint import EndpointCreateOp,
  ModelDeployOp
          4

  @kfp.dsl.pipeline(
    name="automl-image-training",
    pipeline_root="gs://my-bucket/pipeline-root/")
def pipeline(project_id: str):
    # 1) Create an AutoML dataset from CSV on GCS
    ds_op = ImageDatasetCreateOp(
        project=project_id,
        display_name="flowers-dataset",
        gcs_source="gs://my-bucket/data.csv",
import_schema_uri=aiplatform.schema.dataset.ioformat.image.single_label_classification,
    )
    # 2) Train an AutoML model using the dataset
    training_job = AutoMLImageTrainingJobRunOp(
        project=project_id,
        display_name="flowers-training-job",
        prediction_type="classification",
        model_type="CLOUD",
        dataset=ds_op.outputs["dataset"],
        model_display_name="flowers-model",
)
    # 3) Create an endpoint and deploy the trained model
    endpoint_op = EndpointCreateOp(project=project_id, display_name="flowers-
endpoint")
    ModelDeployOp(
        model=training_job.outputs["model"],
        endpoint=endpoint_op.outputs["endpoint"],
        deployed_model_display_name="flowers-deployment",
        automatic_resources_min_replica_count=1,
        automatic_resources_max_replica_count=1,
)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Compile the pipeline to a YAML for Vertex AI
    kfp.compiler.Compiler().compile(
        pipeline_func=pipeline,
        package_path='pipeline.yaml')
• The above example (inspired by the Vertex docs) uses @kfp.dsl.pipeline to define the workflow 8 . It creates a dataset, trains an AutoML model, and deploys it. In your use case, steps could be:
run the Fivetran ingest job, kick off GANimator training, index results into Elasticsearch, etc. Each
step can be a custom component or a script.
• After defining the pipeline, Compiler().compile(...) produces a pipeline.yaml that
contains the full spec for the pipeline run 9 .
• You then submit this to Vertex AI (e.g. using google.cloud.aiplatform.PipelineJob in Python
or gcloud CLI) to execute the pipeline. Vertex pipelines are serverless, so you only pay for the underlying services used by each step (AutoML, notebooks, dataflow, etc.) 7 .
     5

Vertex AI Pipelines thus orchestrates the end-to-end workflow. For example, one pipeline step could invoke the Fivetran connector (or wait on the BigQuery table), the next could trigger the GANimator training (as a custom job), and another could push embeddings to Elasticsearch. This orchestration ensures repeatability
and easy scheduling of the entire ML workflow

Each component lives in its directory. The Fivetran connector is deployed via Fivetran (with its own config). The GANimator folder contains training/inference code and data readers. The Elastic folder runs a Flask app that queries the ES index. The Vertex folder contains the pipeline definition and related scripts. This modular structure keeps components organized and makes development and deployment clearer.
