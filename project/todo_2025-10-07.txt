MoCap Motion-Blending Pipeline: TODOs
Date: 7 October 2025

1. Write orchestration integration test
   - Create a Python integration test that triggers the Cloud Function (via HTTP or Pub/Sub).
   - Wait for a response and verify successful Vertex AI pipeline job creation.
   - Ensure robust error handling and logging.

2. Verify orchestration configuration
   - Validate all environment variables, GCS paths, and pipeline.yaml references in Cloud Function and pipeline code.
   - Update documentation if needed.

3. Deep file validation tests
   - Extend test scripts to perform deeper validation of motion files (.fbx, .glb, .trc, .npy) in seed_motions, build_motions, blend_snn folders.
   - Check schema/content for compatibility.

4. Update project documentation
   - Update MoCap Motion-Blending Data Pipeline.docx.txt to reflect new modules, orchestration changes, and test coverage.

5. Codebase cleanup and review
   - Review and clean up codebase for clarity, modularity, and best practices.
   - Remove unused code, add comments, and ensure all modules are referenced in documentation.

6. Implement blending and search UI
   - Build a simple web UI for motion blending and search.
   - Allow users to select input motions, set blend parameters, and perform search queries.
   - Integrate UI with backend APIs for blending and search.
